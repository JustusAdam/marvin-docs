You can get a release version of marvin on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/marvin).

However this library is still a very early stage so you might want to get updates quicker. 
You can do so by using [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org) and adding a recent commit of this repository to your `stack.yaml` file.
Stack will take care of downloading and building it for you.

For the regex module marvin further requires the `-dev` version of the `icu` library.
