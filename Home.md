Welcome to marvins documentation.

Marvin is a Haskell framework for creating chat bots, inspired by [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com).
Marvin aims to recreate the ease of use and straightforward API of Hubot, and combine it with the safety guarantees and purity of Haskell and the higher efficiency.

If you are new to marvin you may want to get started with the [installation instructions](installing) and/or [how to script with marvin](scripting).
